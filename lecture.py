# Merge Sort Algorithm

# Step 1

# In this project, you'll learn data structures by building the merge sort algorithm.

# This is a sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer principle to sort collections of data. 
# That is, it 'divides' a collection into smaller sub-parts, and 'conquers' the sub-parts by sorting them 
# independently, then merges the sorted sub-parts.

# Create a function called merge_sort. This function will handle the task of sorting a list of numbers.

# Use the pass keyword in the function body.

def merge_sort():
    pass

# Step 2

# You'll need a parameter that denotes the data collection to be sorted. 
# Create a parameter called array in the merge_sort function.

def merge_sort(array):
    pass
